# universally_acclaimed
Generate simple line charts of the number of Metacritic "universally acclaimed" albums for each major genre per release year, from 2000 to `current year`-1.

Any single album can belong to more than one genre, and compound genres are split into their component genres (For example, a "Pop/Rock" album is a Pop album and a Rock album).

Requires bs4, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy packages, all of which are available in the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) of Python3.
